To solve this issue, ensure that the calculations within the `calc()` function always result in a valid number. You can use conditional statements or other logic to prevent division by zero or other operations that could lead to `NaN`.  For example, you can use JavaScript to handle these calculations before applying the result to CSS using JavaScript variables, or use CSS variables and functions strategically to avoid operations that could generate NaN.
