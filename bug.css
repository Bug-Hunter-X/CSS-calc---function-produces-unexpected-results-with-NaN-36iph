The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations. However, if you try to use it to calculate a value that results in `NaN` (Not a Number), it can lead to unexpected behavior. For example, if you try to divide by zero, the result will be `NaN`, and the CSS property will not be applied correctly. This can lead to unexpected layout issues or styling problems, making debugging challenging.
